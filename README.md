 # Horiseon Homepage (Module 01 Assignment)

## Description

Horiseon, a marketing agency, tasked me with making their website follow accessibility standards. This involved changing a bunch of tags in the index.html file to be more semantic, adding a title to the webpage, adding alt attributes to the imagies, and checking to make sure all header tags are in sequential order. I also cleaned up the style.css document to remove duplicates and make it more readable. These changes did not impact the apperance of the website, as seen below in the image provided by the customer.
