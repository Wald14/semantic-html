 # Horiseon Homepage

## Description

Horiseon, a marketing agency tasked me with making their website follow accessibility standards. This involved changing a bunch of tags in the index.html file to be more semantic, adding a title to the webpage, adding alt attributes to the imagies, and checking to make sure all header tags are in sequential order. I also cleaned up the style.css document to remove duplicates and make it more readable.
